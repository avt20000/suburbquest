           <p>“Mom had to go to her appointment today, remember?”</p>
           <p>You remember. You’d <a class="flav" href=./forgottencopy.html>forgotten</a>, despite the fact that she’d mentioned it several times to you yesterday and 
            again this morning when you told her your plans for the day.</p>
            <p>“Oh…right. Thanks”</p>
     
               <p>“Yeah, no problem. But I really have to get back to work now, okay?” 
                Your brother glances up at you with much more seriousness than any freshman 
                should have towards their schoolwork.</p>
                
               <p>“Don’t work too hard, <a class="flav" href=./bug.html>bug</a>” you say. </p>
                
                <p>“Bye now!” he says pointedly. </p>
                
                <p>You leave, making sure to close the door behind you.</p>
