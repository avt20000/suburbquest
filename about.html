        <h1>about</h1>
        <p>My project is a choose-your-own adventure game that I coded with html and css. 
            The game tells the narrative of Rory, who unfortunately does not have access to a car on 
            that particular day and needs to get to a neighboring town by using public transportation. 
            This premise is incredibly reminiscent of my experience growing up in the suburbs, and throughout 
            the project I pull a lot of locations, names, and imagery from my time living in Kirkland, Washington.</p>

        <p>Suburb Quest is a depiction of loneliness, avoidance, and the suburban gothic. If I were writing a formal essay, 
            I would have followed many of the same themes. There is a distinct loneliness in not fitting the mold of a suburb, 
            as seen in films like Donnie Darko and Clueless, which were my two big inspirations for this project.</p>

<p>The gameplay is entirely choice-based, and different choices lead to different outcomes. In Suburb Quest, I wanted to slowly hint 
    that things are not going very well in Rory’s life from a social standpoint, but the full events can only be uncovered with multiple 
    playthroughs and careful examination of the text. In Donnie Darko, I was fascinated by the idea of parallel universes, and in a sense 
    Suburb Quest emulates this as every decision by the player alters the outcome of Rory’s day, but every decision also changes how the 
    story is read. Information is entirely conditional to choices made by the player, and two different players can come away from the 
    project with entirely different levels of understanding Rory's life.</p>

    <p>While the story depicted in Suburb Quest is completely fictional, it does follow a lot of threads I experienced. It was very common 
        in my high school to see a rumor be created, and a large group of people to ignore someone on behalf of a single party that had an 
        issue with them. The distinctly lemming-like behavior and group thinking was incredibly bizarre to me, but it was still something 
        I’m ashamed to say I participated in due to the nature of my upbringing and surroundings. The avoidance is also a big part, which 
        is why the player must get deep into the choices to get Rory to open up about their traumas. Suburban gothic continually demonstrates 
        this idea that on the surface, everything is normal and fine (Stepford Wives, Get Out, People Under the Stairs, etc.), but closer 
        inspection reveals the truth and rot underneath. I wanted to get a similar effect in this story.</p>

    <p>The aesthetic is based on a kind of journal, where Rory might document the day with red and blue ink drawings. </p>
