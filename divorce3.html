            Or not really after the divorce…but after the stress of the divorce that had caused 
            you to completely shut down. You became withdrawn, and anything social felt impossible. 
            Especially with Emma. She tried to be there for you, but she never really understood. 
            Eventually, she got fed up with how you couldn’t just be your old self anymore. 
            How you weren’t any fun anymore. How you weren’t there for her when she needed you. 
            She got so angry. And that day you’d shown up at school, and seen the look she gave you, 
            the hatred in her eyes, was a day you’d never forget. </div>
