        <p>“Hey mom, do you remember Michael Callahan?”</p>
        <p>She looks at you, surprised. “Oh, sure. We used to spend a lot of time with 
            Mike and Deb. We had a lot of fun together, back in the day.”</p>
        <p>“I ran into him on the bus today.”</p>
        <p>“Ah, and how is he?”</p>
        <p>“He’s good. I think. We didn’t really talk long.”</p>
        <p>
            “Huh…” your mom seems thoughtful. “Maybe I should give them a call.”
            </p>
        <p>“Maybe.”</p>
        <p>
            You head to your room to decompress and scroll Tiktok. You hope your mom does call, but deep down, you don’t think she will.
