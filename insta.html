            For a while, Samantha and Maddy (though mostly Samantha) ran an “anonymous” instagram account for your high school, 
            @lw.caughtlacking. Everyone knew it was them. They would film people they found cringe, 
            and post it with an appropriately snarky caption. The account wasn’t taken down until 
            they posted a video of an openly gay student, who tended to dress pretty androgynously. 
            He was going into the men’s room and they’d captioned it “wrong bathroom, babe”. 
            The student had reported it, which got the account removed, but they’d never 
            actually faced any consequences for it, academic or otherwise.
