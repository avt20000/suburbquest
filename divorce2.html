          You don't want to think about that right now. But if you pushed yourself, you would think:
          after your parents divorced, you started absorbing a lot of the fallout. It hit your mom really hard, and 
          you tried your best to be there for her. Your social battery had never been very much, and the stress of the divorce suddenly made everything so much harder. It’s not that you wanted to blow off your friends, or withdraw so much, but it just felt impossible to act normal and happy when everything was falling apart. And your friends tried to be there for you, but they just didn’t understand. Nobody understood. 
          And over time, as you continued to withdraw, they just stopped trying. You couldn’t really blame them. </div>
