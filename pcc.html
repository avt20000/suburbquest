            PCC, or Puget Consumers Co-op, is a staple of the Western Washington suburb. 
            It’s expensive, it’s organic, and shopping there can make you at least feel a 
            little like you care about the environment. The cookies are really good, at least. 
            When you were younger, and your family had a little bit more disposable income, 
            you used to take <a class="flav" href="./pcc2.html">cooking classes</a> at the same PCC you had now found yourself stranded in.</div>
