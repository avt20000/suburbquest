            His room is…meticulously arranged. The walls are completely white, there’s never anything on the floor, 
            and the only things on his desk are the computer, the mouse, and the keyboard. 
            His room had become so devoid of personality since he started decorating on his own, claiming that the 
            “minimalism” helped him focus better. You, however, could never live in a room so empty. 
            Even being in here starts making you feel a little claustrophobic.</div>
