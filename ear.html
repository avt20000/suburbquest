        <div class="note">Whenever you’re outside alone, you have your earbuds in. 
            It makes you feel a lot less awkward, like you have something to do. Recently, you’ve been 
            listening to a lot of Nirvana. You know it’s cliche, but it’s popular for a reason, right? And the lyrics 
            just speak to you in a big way. It helps you feel a little less lonely, knowing somewhere, sometime, someone 
            understood exactly how you were feeling.
