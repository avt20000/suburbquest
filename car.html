            Your mom drives a grey Mazda CX-9. It’s an older model, but it’s been reliable through the years. Since you turned sixteen, 
            you’ve been allowed to drive it too, which considerably expanded your social life. Your mom is able to work partially remotely, 
            which means there usually isn’t too much conflict over who gets to use the car. Despite this, she does need to use it more 
            frequently than you do. Most of your friend’s families have two cars, and some of your friends even have their own, so you 
            try to get rides from them when you can. You act like it doesn’t bother you, but you can’t deny the rush of freedom and possibility that comes from being behind the wheel.
