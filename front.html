        <p>Taking too long to decide where to sit makes you feel a little pathetic. You slide into a seat, across from the man. 
        </p>
        <p>Wrong choice.</p>
        <p>“Rory? Is that you?!” says the man. You turn to look at him. Oh god. He knows you. 
            More distressingly, <i>you know him.</i></p>
        <p>“It’s me, Mike. Michael Callahan. I’m friends with…” he catches himself. 
            “I used to spend a lot of time with your parents.” </p>
