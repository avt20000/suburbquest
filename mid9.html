      <p>With the little bit of phone battery you have left, you figure out how to get home. Not too difficult, 
        just take the same bus going the other way. It’s better if you don’t bother your mom, she has enough to deal with. 
        She can’t be picking you up every time you get lost!</p>

        <p>You get back home about an hour later. You flop onto your bed and start scrolling through Tiktok. 
            That was enough effort for the day.</p>
