        <p>“Oh, she’s doing good” you mumble, avoiding eye contact. You know it’s not true, and that your mom has been incredibly 
            lonely since your dad left, but you really don’t feel like getting into it with this 
            quasi-stranger. On the bus, no less.</p>
        <p>“Well, I’m glad to hear that!” Mike seems relieved. Almost like you assuaged something in him. 
            “It was nice to see you again! Here’s my stop.” He gets off, leaving you to sit and ponder 
            the interaction. Weren’t these supposed to be friends of your mom? Why hadn’t they 
            reached out to her? Then again, you could relate to being disappointed by the 
            people who were supposed to be your <a class="flav" href="./friends.html">friends</a>.</p>
            <p>
                The rest of the ride is uneventful. You make it to Redmond Town Center and step out into the sun.
                </p>
            <p>You find your classmate sitting at a table by the fountain, and settle in to spend a couple hours working on your project. 
                When it starts getting dark, you decide to wrap up for the day.</p>
            <p>“Well, I should head home. See you Monday, then. For our presentation.” Your classmate says.
            </p>
            <p>“See you Monday.” You turn and go your separate ways, him to the parking 
                garage and you to the bus stop. </p>
            <p>
                When you get home, you see your mom working on the computer. She looks tired. “Hey Rory. How was your day?” she says, managing a warm smile.
                </p>
            <p>“Oh, it was okay. I went to Redmond to work on a project with a classmate.”</p>
            <p>“That sounds nice, babe. Did you get a lot of work done?”</p>
            <p>“Yeah.”</p>
            <p>You consider bringing up your run-in with Mike.
