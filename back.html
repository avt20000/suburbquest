      <p>As you walk towards the back it becomes clear to you that you know these two girls. 
        You suspect these girls would probably pretend not to know your name if pressed, but you know they know 
        who you are too. They go to your high school, and you’ve actually shared classes since kindergarten.
       <p>The alarm bells of panic and anxiety go off in your head, but it’s too late to turn back. They’ve already spotted you.</p>
        <p>They get quiet as they see you pass by and slink into a seat behind them. Then they start giggling. You know it’s about you. 
        You know it’s about <a class="flav" href="./hap.html">what happened</a>. You turn up the volume on your music and stare out the window, hoping 
        they can’t tell how red your face is.</p>

        <p>The rest of the ride is uneventful. You make it to Redmond Town Center and step out 
            into the sun.</p>
        <p><i>"wya?"</i>, you text your classmate. He responds quickly, and you find him sitting at a table by the fountain. You settle in and spend a couple hours working on your project. 
            When it starts getting dark, you decide to wrap up for the day.</p>
        <p>“Well, I should head home. See you Monday, then. For our presentation.” your classmate says.</p>
        <p>“See you Monday.” You turn and go your separate ways, him to the parking garage and you to the 
            bus stop. </p>
        <p>By some nightmarish coincidence, you pass by a bench and see the two girls from the bus sitting there, passing a vape back and forth. 
            They eye you, and you can only guess what <a class="flav" href="./snap.html">snapchat story</a> they’re drafting in their heads: 
            <i>“Guess who we ran into…no really! Rory. Yeah. I can’t believe they’d show their face in public.”</i></p>
