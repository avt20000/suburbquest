            You knock on the door. 
            <p>“What?” comes a voice through the door</p>
           <p>“Do you know where mom is? I need to go to Redmond today, but the keys are gone.”</p>
           <p>“Mom had to go to her appointment today, remember?”</p>
           <p>You remember. You’d <a class="flav" href=./forgotten.html>forgotten</a>, despite the fact that she’d mentioned it several times to you yesterday and 
            again this morning when you told her your plans for the day.</p>
            <p>“Oh…right. Thanks”</p>
            <p>There’s no response. You can imagine that he’s put his headphones back on, and gotten back to 
                whatever it is he does on the computer.</p>
