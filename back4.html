        <p>“Uh…I just wanted to ask if we had to finish our paper for Econ this weekend. 
            Mr. Hollinger didn’t email us anything but maybe I missed something.”</p>

        <p>
            “Oh…I wasn’t there last class. Sorry.” Maddy mumbles.
            </p>

            good grade for the semester. You feel good about it, and your classmate looks happy too.
