      <p>“Thanks for picking me up” you say, lamely. </p>

       <p>“No problem” says your classmate. He glances at you sidelong. You have a hard time reading his expression. 
        He doesn’t seem too angry, but then again, he doesn’t exactly seem happy with you either. </p>
        
       <p>“So do you still have enough time to work on the project?”</p>
        
       <p>“Yeah, we can go work somewhere. Is a coffeeshop okay?”</p> 
        
       <p>“Sounds good.”</p>
        
       <p>
        He drives a little further down and parks in front of <a class="flav" href="soulfood.html">SoulFood</a>. You get out and order some drinks to successfully commandeer a table, then get situated.
        </p>

       <p>“I always hate ordering here,” you say, trying to lighten the mood. To your surprise, he laughs.</p>
        
       <p>“Me too. Having to stand there and say something like “Chai of the tiger” with a straight face kills me. But the coffee is good.”</p>
        <p>“The coffee is good!”</p>
        <p>You continue working together for the next couple hours, and feel satisfied towards your contribution. It feels good to have made it, to put in the effort. You can’t remember the last time you had such a good time doing work, or even the last time you felt good being around other people. 
            You hadn’t been very social since the <a class="flav" href="./incident.html">incident</a>, or really since the <a class="flav" href="./divorce2.html">divorce</a>. You’re glad you pushed yourself to come tonight. </p>
            <p>“Well, I think it’s time for me to go. Do you want a ride home? You live in Houghton, right? 
                That’s not too far from me.” your classmates stands up and looks at you expectantly.</p>
