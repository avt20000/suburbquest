            Your mom is great. You get along really well, and like to spend quality time with her by watching movies together. 
            She works in corporate at a mid-sized tech company in Bellevue, a neighboring city. 
            She makes enough on her own to support the whole family, but you know college is going to be 
            a struggle to pay for without additional financial support. She puts on a brave face, 
            but the <a href="./divorce.html">divorce</a> has been really hard on her. Your mom and <a href="./dad.html">dad</a> would frequently hangout with 
            other couples in your neighborhood, but since their divorce, she hasnâ€™t heard much from their 
            old friends. You try to spend more time with her and support her whenever you can, which has taken 
            away time from your own social life.</div>
