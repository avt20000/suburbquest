      <p>“Sure, thanks!” you say. It’ll get you home a lot faster than dealing with the bus again, at least. On the ride, your classmate seems almost…nervous. 
        Like he’s thinking about saying something, but isn’t really sure how to bring it up.</p>

       <p> “So…” he says, glancing at you. “Uh…I just wanted to say, thanks for showing up today.”
        </p>
        
       <p>You’re not too surprised. You don’t have the best academic reputation, nor the 
        best reputation with following through recently. </p>
        
       <p>“And I just wanted to say, I’m sorry about your parents. I…uh…I heard about it from my mom. 
        She’s pretty…involved. Sorry.” He’s really nervous now, like he’s confessing something he 
        shouldn’t know. A feeling of shame starts flooding through you. You were aware that everyone 
        knew, and of course everyone knew about what happened, but being confronted with it makes 
        it so much more real.
        </p> 
        
       <p>“Uh…yeah. Thanks.” you mumble, knotting your hands together. You’re not really sure 
        how to reply. 
        </p>
        
       <p> “I just wanted to say…my cousin’s parents divorced when we were younger. Uh, my aunt and 
        uncle. I’m not trying to say I understand what you’re going through, but uh, I get it. 
        What makes it so hard, or why things might be hard for you. Sorry. I don’t mean to-”
        </p>
        
       <p>“No, it’s okay. I understand. Thank you, really. It means a lot.” you look at him, quickly. 
        He’s staring at the road, but his face is bright red.</p>
        
       <p>“And also…I don’t think it’s true. You know. What everyone said you did. 
        I never believed it. I’m sorry she’s been so…well, you know. <a class="flav" href="emma.html">Emma</a>.”</p>
        <p>“Oh.” Now you really don’t know what to say. It’s the first time someone has talked to you about it openly, and the first time someone has even seemed remotely open to 
            hearing your side of what happened.</p>
        <p>Your classmate drops you off in front of your house, and you thank him for the ride and the conversation. 
            Later that night, he texts asking if you wanted to hangout for real some time. 
            You smile. Maybe you could even manage it.</p>
