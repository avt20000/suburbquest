            <p>He <i>was</i> a friend of your parents, right? So you should be able to tell him 
                that truth, right? </p>
            <p>
                “Um…well, you know it’s been hard. She hasn’t really been…adjusting well.”
                </p>
            <p>
                He seems a little shocked at your frankness. And maybe a little guilty, too
                </p>
            <p>“Oh, I’m sorry to hear that. She was always so funny, you know. I’ll call her soon. 
                I should’ve called her earlier. I’ll call her soon.”</p>
            <p>“Uh…okay. Sure.”</p>
            <p>“Well, it was really nice catching up with you, Rory. This is my stop. 
                But I’ll call her soon.”</p>
            <p>Mike stepped off the bus, leaving you behind to ponder the interaction. It struck you as odd that your mom’s friends hadn’t thought to talk to her after the divorce.
                 But the logic of the adults in your life had always struck you as odd. </p>
            <p>
                The rest of the ride is uneventful. You make it to Redmond Town Center and step out into the sun.
                </p>
            <p>You find your classmate sitting at a table by the fountain, and settle in to spend a couple hours working on your project. 
                When it starts getting dark, you decide to wrap up for the day.</p>
            <p>“Well, I should head home. See you Monday, then. For our presentation.” Your classmate says.
            </p>
            <p>“See you Monday.” You turn and go your separate ways, him to the parking 
                garage and you to the bus stop. </p>
            <p>Later that night, your mom seems strangely upbeat. Over dinner, she mentions that she got a call from an old friend, and that she’s planning on having dinner with them soon. You smile to yourself. You’re glad Mike followed through on his insistence to call her, 
                it seems to have made your mom a little happier. </p>
