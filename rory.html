        <div class="note">You like to cook, play games on your computer, and practice the guitar. 
            You dislike when it rains, sitting on the roof, and have an undefined aversion to dogs. 
            You donâ€™t really know why, but every time you think about the future, your stomach twists into knots 
            and you feel really anxious. So you try to take things day by day. </div>
