       <p>You turn away and turn the music up on your phone. He turns away too. If the moment was awkward before, it’s now become unbearable. But you know that 
        he’ll bring up the <a class="flav" href="./divorce4.html">divorce</a>. And you’re not ready to talk about it. Not now. Not here. </p>
        <p>Even though you know it’s wrong to ignore him, the confrontation would be so much worse. </p>
        <p>
            The rest of the ride is uneventful. You make it to Redmond Town Center and step out into the sun.
            </p>
        <p>
            You find your classmate sitting at a table by the fountain, and settle in to spend a couple hours working on your project. When it starts getting dark, you decide to wrap up for the day.
            </p>
        <p>“Well, I should head home. See you Monday, then. For our presentation.” Your classmate says.</p>
        <p>“See you Monday.” You turn and go your separate ways, him to the parking garage and you to the bus stop. </p>
        <p>When you get home, your mom is making dinner. You rush to help her, but she waves you off. </p>
        <p>
            “You’ve been out all day, Rory. Go relax. I’m fine”
            </p>
        <p>
            “Oh, okay.” You head to your room to decompress and watch Tiktoks. However, the guilt of ignoring Mike eats at you all night. You feel like, somehow, you made the wrong choice.
