      <p>“Oh, nah. It’s okay. Thank you though.” you mumble, staring at your hands. You already had to accept a ride from him after the whole bus thing, and 
        you couldn’t imagine the embarrassment of having to do it again.</p>

       <p> “Oh, okay. See you Monday, then. For our presentation.” Your classmate looks like 
        he wants to say more, but doesn’t.
        </p>
        
       <p>“See you Monday.” You turn and leave, and head to the bus stop alone. 
        You make it home about an hour later, then flop onto your bed to scroll through Tiktok. 
        The day took a lot out of you.
        </p>
        
       <p>On Monday, you present your project with your classmate, and hopefully it’s enough to secure a good grade for the semester. You feel good about it, 
        and your classmate looks happy too. 
        </p>
