        <div class="note">You don’t know your classmate very well. When you were partnered up on the project, 
            you could tell he had wished it was anybody but you. You couldn’t really blame him, he was always concerned about his GPA, 
            and you were known to slack off. Still, you didn’t want to make him do the project alone, or make him think you didn’t care.
             So it was important for you to be able to show up.
