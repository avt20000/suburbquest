      <p>You walk past them, trying to keep your head down. Your earbuds are jammed firmly into your ears, and your heart is pounding. You don’t want to know. You don’t want to know anything they’d have to say about 
        you. You’ve seen them hanging out with <a class="flav" href="./emma2.html">Emma</a>, so you can only imagine what they think about you.</p>
        <p>What they think they know about you.</p>
        <p>You know it isn’t true. But isn’t reality relative? If everyone believes something, and shares their version of 
            events between them, doesn’t that somehow make it true?</p>
        <p>Your music does little to drown out their laughing. You can hear it. They don’t seem to be ashamed of it at all. The bench is too close to the bus stop. 
            They’re too close. You close your eyes and pray the bus isn’t late.</p>
        <p>When it shows up, you climb on and get as far back as possible. It takes you about thirty minutes to get home, and when you finally arrive you get under the covers and blast your music to try and drown out the thoughts 
            swirling around your head in a panicked frenzy. Today was not your day.</p>
