        <div class="note">If you were a mirror of your dad growing up, your little brother is definitely a mirror of your mom. 
            He’s intimidatingly smart, academically focused, and is already taking the most advanced math course available in his 
            freshman year. He wants to go into the tech industry. He’s only two years younger than you, and you always got along well 
            with him growing up. However, since your parents divorced, he’s been more and more withdrawn, which worries you. </div>
