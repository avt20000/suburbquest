        <div class="note">You always really liked to cook. You still do, but now it’s become 
            more of a way for you to support your mom. But you really miss taking classes. 
            You’ve even considered pursuing culinary school, but you know that your mom really wants you 
            to get a bachelor’s in something stable, at a traditional university. Cooking was really more of your 
            dad’s thing, honestly. It was him who paid for the lessons, and who always dropped you off and 
            picked you up. It feels weird, almost, being in this parking lot without him. 
            You haven’t been back since you stopped taking lessons.
