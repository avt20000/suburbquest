        <div class="note">Kirkland is a suburban town across the lake from Seattle. It’s populated mostly by tech developers 
            working for one of the many tech companies in the region, and their offspring. In general, residents of Kirkland 
            would be defined as “upper middle class”. In general, Kirkland would be described as a “nice area”. The primary mode 
            of transportation is by car. It’s not impossible to get around without one, but it is significantly more tedious and 
            complicated.  </div>
